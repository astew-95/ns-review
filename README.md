 I relay the most recent research on the subject of Neutron Star Cooling,
outlining details of recent advances towards determining a NS radius as well as the significance of understanding
Neutron Star cooling for the determination of a Neutron Star equation of state (EOS). I discuss the significance of
prior and recent advancements.



# Cooling theory

The two main factors contributing to the cooling theory
are the neutrino emissivity Q, heat capacity Cv, and thermal conductivity of neutron star matter. General relativistic corrections for standard heat equations in the interior
of a star can be solved to determine effective temperature
and effective surface temperature (Ts) for the neutron star,
as derived in [3]. The NS thermal luminosity is:

$$ L= 4πσR^2T^4 s (t)$$

where L refers to a locally-flat reference frame on the NS surface.
The apparent luminosity to a distant observer and apparent effective temperature to the distant observer can be
described with:

$$ L^\infty= L(1−r_g/R)$$


$$T^\infty_s = T_s \sqrt{1−r_g/R} $$

where $r_g = \frac{2GM}{c^2}$ is the Schwarzschild radius [4].
The equation of state and composition of the neutron
star core will affect neutrino emission mechanisms. Additionally, superfluity and the presence of strong magnetic
fields can affect neutrons star temperature. These factors
affect the thermal conductivity and the relation between
the internal surface temperature of the star.
